Rice Bootcamp Module 11 Assignment: Zoo Keepr


## Introduction

As the most widely used Node.js server framework, Express will allow you to quickly and easily establish API routes and associated HTTP request methods. Routing is how you design the server to handle responses when a client makes a request at a specific endpoint, or URL. You’ve already learned how to make requests from the client side—now you’ll learn how those requests are handled on the server side.
